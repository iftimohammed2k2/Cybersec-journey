# Hydra SSH Brute Force Mini Project

This project simulates a brute-force attack on an SSH server using THC-Hydra. It assumes a target with SSH service open and a known username.

**Components:**
- `wordlist.txt`: A basic password list
- `hydra_command.sh`: Script that runs the Hydra command with explanations
- `output.log`: Logs the result after running the attack
